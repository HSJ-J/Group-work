	<h1><center><p>The airplane</p></center></h1>

	<h2><p>what is an airplane?</p></h2>
		
	<h3><p>The airplane is one of the most significant inventions in the early 20th century and is recognized as being invented by the Americans, the Wright brothers. Their flight on December 17, 1903 was recognized by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale (FAI) as "the first controlled sustained powered flight by a heavier-than-air aircraft", and in the same year they founded the "Wright Aircraft Company" . Since the invention of the airplane, it has increasingly become an indispensable tool for modern civilization. It profoundly changed and affected people's lives and started the history of people's conquest of the blue sky.</p></h3>

	
	<h3><p>Aircraft refers to a fixed-wing aircraft propelled forward by thrust generated by jet engines, propellers, or rocket engines. Aircraft come in various sizes, shapes and wing configurations. The wide range of uses for aircraft include entertainment, transportation of cargo and people, military and research. Globally, civil aviation transports more than 4 billion passengers on passenger aircraft every year and transports more than 200 billion ton-kilometers of cargo every year, which is less than 1% of global freight volume. Most aircraft are flown by a pilot on board, but some are designed to be controlled remotely or by a computer, such as drones.</p></h3>

	 <h2><p>Aircraft structure</p></h2>

     <h3><p>The aircraft consists of six parts: fuselage, wings, tail, power unit, landing gear and control system. The power unit generates thrust or pull, and the fixed wings generate lift, allowing the aircraft to soar in the sky.</p></h3>

     <h2><p>Why do airplanes affect the world?</p></h2>
     <h3><p>Since the invention of the airplane, it has increasingly become an indispensable means of transportation for modern civilization. It profoundly changes and affects people's lives. Thanks to the invention of the airplane, the time for humans to travel around the world has been greatly shortened. Being able to fly to every corner of the earth in less than a day is not a miracle for humans who lived before the 20th century.
The intricate air routes connect countries around the world and provide people with convenient and fast passenger transportation. It is very common for modern people to be in Beijing in the morning and appear in another city thousands of miles away without any fatigue in the afternoon. Before the 20th century, it was unthinkable. From then on, the steep mountains and the endless ocean will no longer be daunting. Silver swallows closely connect people of different races and skin colors in different regions. Through constant exchanges, people sow friendship, convey information, achieve mutual communication, mutual understanding and mutual promotion, and jointly advance human civilization. The invention of the airplane also enabled the unprecedented development of the air transportation industry. Many raw materials required for industrial development have new sources and channels, which greatly reduces people's dependence on local natural resources. Especially after the birth of supersonic aircraft, air transportation has become more prosperous. Livestock that are not suitable for long-term transportation and delicious food that is difficult to preserve for a long time can also be transported across the world by air and shared by people around the world. As humans march deeper into the earth, aircraft are also widely used in geological exploration. Aircraft equipped with cameras or an electronic device called a Shoreland system can quickly and accurately map vast areas, including rugged and hard-to-reach places. By stitching together aerial photos one by one, you can create an excellent topographic map. This is much simpler and easier than the old surveying method. Even the ice-covered and inaccessible Arctic and Antarctic, once only accessible to explorers, can now be reached without difficulty by plane.</p></h3>
