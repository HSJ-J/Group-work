      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired
        immunity to a particular infectious or malignant disease.The safety and
        effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified.A vaccine
        typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing
        microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the
        microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent
        stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat,
        destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms
        associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.

      <h2>1.How vaccines work:</h2>
      <p>
        Prevention of infectious diseases: Vaccines can help the body produce
        antibodies or cellular immune responses, making the body resistant to
        specific pathogens, thus preventing the occurrence of infections and
        diseases. Controlling the spread of diseases: Through group vaccination
        and vaccination plans, the spread of diseases can be effectively
        controlled and the goals of social public health can be achieved.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>2. Types of vaccines:</h2>
      <p>
        Virus vaccines: including inactivated vaccines, live attenuated
        vaccines, etc., which stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies
        by giving part or the whole virus to the human body. Bacterial vaccines:
        For bacterial diseases, such as whooping cough, pneumococcus, etc., the
        human immune system is activated by introducing bacterial components or
        products. Recombinant protein vaccine: Vaccine prepared using genetic
        engineering technology, such as HPV vaccine, influenza vaccine, etc.
        Vector vaccine: The target antigen gene is inserted into a vector, and
        the vector expresses the antigen to induce an immune response. DNA/RNA
        vaccine: uses DNA or RNA molecules to carry target pathogen genes and
        activates the immune system through the transfection mechanism.
      </p>

      <h2>3.Importance of vaccines:</h2>
      <p>
        Vaccines are one of the most effective means of preventing infectious
        diseases and have made important contributions to human health and
        social public health. Through vaccination, many infectious diseases have
        been effectively controlled or eliminated, such as smallpox, polio, etc.
        Overall, vaccines play a key role in preventing infectious diseases and
        maintaining public health and are one of the important achievements of
        medical science.
