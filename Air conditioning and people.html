          <li>
            <b>Energy Efficiency:</b>Modern air conditioners often come with
            energy-saving technologies, such as inverters, which can effectively
            reduce energy consumption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Multifunctional:</b> Many air conditioners have additional
            features like dehumidification and air purification, improving
            indoor air quality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Aesthetically Pleasing: </b>Central air conditioning systems are
            hidden installations that coordinate with interior design styles
            without occupying extra space.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reduce humidity: </b>In humid climates, air conditioners can
            reduce indoor humidity and prevent mold growth
          </li>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h2>Disadvantages:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>High Installation Cost:</b> Especially for central air

        Home air conditioning systems everywhere
      </h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Home air conditioning systems are most common and popular in West Asia.
        Due to the hot weather and high living standards in summer, air
        conditioning has become a daily necessity. With the improvement of
        living standards, air conditioning has gradually become popular in
        wealthy communities in Southeast Asia with tropical climates, such as
        Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines.
      </p>
      <p>
        East Asia, such as Japan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and
        Taiwan, are important producing areas for air conditioners. Most air
        conditioning systems manufactured in this region are window type (window
        type) or split type, with the split type being more advanced and
        expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, home air conditioning systems are more common in
        the east coast and south. However, in the north and west coast of the
        United States, summer temperatures are not high, so people rarely use
        them. However, central air conditioning systems are more common in the
        United States and have become the unofficial standard for new homes in
        Florida. In countries in the southern hemisphere such as South America
        and Australia, the summer is also very hot in December, so northern
        areas are also equipped with air conditioners.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Europe, home air conditioning systems are relatively rare, partly
        because Europe has a milder climate without hot summers and social
        reasons. For example, Spanish people traditionally perform siesta and
        travel north to France to spend long summer vacations; but the world's
        climate The phenomenon of warming may make air conditioning systems more
        common. Lack of air conditioning in homes, nursing homes and medical
        facilities may have contributed to the 2003 heat wave in Europe that
        killed 35,000 people.

        <b>In the 19th century</b>, the British scientist and inventor

          >Michael Faraday</a
        >
        discovered that compressing and liquefying a certain gas could freeze
        the air. This phenomenon occurred when liquefied ammonia evaporated. His

        <b>In 1842</b>, Florida physician John B. Gorey used compressor
        technology to create ice to provide cool air to patients at his hospital
        in Apalachicola, Florida. He wanted to use this ice-making technology to
        regulate the temperature of the building and applied for a patent.
        However, due to lack of funds, it was not implemented. Alfred R Wolff
        (1859-1909), an engineer in Hoboken, New Jersey, helped design a new
        air-conditioning system and applied the technology to commercial
        buildings. He is considered one of the pioneers of air-conditioning.

        <b>In late 1902</b>, the first modern, electrically powered air
        conditioning system was invented by

        only controls the temperature, but also controls the humidity of the air
        to improve the process quality of a printing factory in Brooklyn, New
        York. This technology provides a low temperature and humidity
        environment, making the paper area and ink arrangement more accurate.
        That is why the dehumidifier was invented. Later, Carrier's technology
        began to be used in the workplace to improve production efficiency.

        With gradual development, air conditioning began to be used to improve
        the comfort of homes and cars. Built <b>in 1906</b>, the Royal Victoria
        Hospital in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is of special significance in
        terms of architectural engineering and is known as the world's first
        air-conditioned building.

        <b>In 1906</b>, Stuart W. Cramer of Charlotte, North Carolina, USA, was
        looking for ways to increase the air humidity in his southern textile
        mills. Cramer named the technology "air conditioning" and patented it in
        the same year as a replacement for water conditioning. Water
        conditioning was a well-known procedure at the time that made textile
        production easier. He combined water vapor with ventilation systems to
        "condition" and transform the air in the factory, controlling air
        humidity, which is all-important in textile factories. Willis Carrier
        used this name and put it into the name of the company he founded in
        1907: "American Gallia Air Conditioning Company" (today's Carrier
        Company).
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The original air conditioners and refrigerators used toxic gases such as
        ammonia and methyl chloride. The leakage of this type of gas can cause
        major accidents. Thomas Midgley invented chlorofluorocarbon gas in 1928
        and named it Freon. This refrigerant is much safer for humans, but is
        harmful to the atmospheric ozone layer. Freon is DuPont's trademark for
        CFC, HCFC or HFC refrigerants, each of which also includes a number to
        indicate the molecular makeup of its ingredients (e.g. R-11, R-12, R-22,
        R- 134). Among them, R-22 HCFC refrigerant, which is the most widely
        used in the field of direct evaporative moderate cooling products, has
        been discontinued in newly produced equipment since 2010, and will be
        completely discontinued in 2020. R-11 and R-12 have been discontinued in
        the United States. As an alternative, some ozone-friendly refrigerants
        have been put into use, including the refrigerant R-410A under the trade
        name "Puron".
