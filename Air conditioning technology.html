        Air conditioning refers to equipment that uses manual means to adjust
        and control the temperature, humidity, flow rate and other parameters of
        the ambient air in a building or structure.<br /><br />Air conditioners
        generally include cold source/heat source equipment, hot and cold medium
        transmission and distribution systems, terminal devices and other
        auxiliary equipment. It mainly includes: refrigeration host, water pump,
        fan and piping system. The terminal device is responsible for utilizing
        the cold and heat transmitted and distributed to specifically handle the
        air condition so that the air parameters of the target environment meet
        certain requirements.<br /><br />Air conditioning is an indispensable
        part of people's modern life. Air conditioning provides people with
        coolness and warmth. However, leaving it on often can also easily cause
        diseases, such as "air conditioning disease", so it needs to be used
        with caution.

      <h2>Freezing cycle</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          In the refrigeration cycle, the heat pump transfers heat from a
          low-temperature heat source to a heat sink in a higher-temperature
          area. The heat will naturally flow in the opposite direction. This is
          the most common form of air conditioning. The operating principle of a
          refrigerator is very similar to this, transferring heat from inside
          the refrigerator to the air outside the refrigerator.
        </p>
        <p>This cycle can be explained by the <b>Carnot cycle.</b></p>
        <p>
          The most common refrigeration cycle uses an electric motor to drive a
          compressor. In a car, the compressor is driven by the engine's
          crankshaft through a pulley, both of which cause the compressor to
          perform a compression cycle. Because evaporation occurs when heat is
          absorbed, and condensation occurs when heat is released, air
          conditioners use a compressor to create a pressure change between two
          compartments and a pump to move the refrigerant. In the refrigeration
          mode, the compressor compresses the refrigerant from the gas state
          into a gas-liquid mixed state. The gas compression process causes the
          refrigerant temperature to rise to nearly <b>100°C</b>. The
          high-temperature and high-pressure mixed refrigerant from the
          compressor flows into the condenser of the outdoor unit. The heat is
          taken away from the copper tubes and aluminum sheets of the condenser
          through the air cooling of the axial flow fan of the outdoor unit. The
          temperature of the refrigerant is reduced to slightly above Outdoor
          temperature. Then, the normal-temperature medium-pressure refrigerant
          passes through the capillary tube, and the pressure it experiences
          decreases sharply. The low-temperature normal-pressure refrigerant,
          whose temperature drops sharply to zero, enters the evaporator of the
          indoor unit through the connecting pipe wrapped with thermal
          insulation cotton. The cross-flow fan of the indoor unit brings The
          air flowing through the copper tube and aluminum foil of the
          evaporator absorbs a large amount of heat, and the low-temperature air
          is blown out of the indoor unit. The normal pressure and normal
          temperature refrigerant coming out of the evaporator returns to the
          compressor through the connecting pipe to start another cycle.

      <h2>Humidity</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Refrigerated air conditioning equipment typically reduces the humidity
          of the treated air. The cooler (below the dew point) evaporator coil
          condenses the water vapor in the treated air. Just as a cold drink
          condenses the water vapor in the air outside the container, the water
          will flow away through the sewage pipe, which will remove the water
          vapor in the freezer space. water vapor and reduce the relative
          humidity. Because the human body naturally lowers its body temperature
          through evaporation of sweat, drier air increases human comfort.
          Comfort air conditioning systems are usually designed to discharge air
          with a relative humidity of between 40% and 60%. In food retailer
          properties, large open freezers serve as highly efficient air
          dehumidifiers.

        <p>
          Ductless systems (often mini-split, though there are now ducted
          mini-split) typically supply conditioned and heated air to a single or
          a few rooms of a building, without ducts and in a decentralized
          manner.Multi-zone or multi-split systems are a common application of
          ductless systems and allow up to eight rooms (zones or locations) to
          be conditioned independently from each other, each with its own indoor
          unit and simultaneously from a single outdoor unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first mini-split system was sold in 1961 by Toshiba in Japan, and
          the first wall-mounted mini-split air conditioner was sold in 1968 in
          Japan by Mitsubishi Electric where small home sizes motivated their
          development. The Mitsubishi model was the first air conditioner to
          have a cross-flow fan.In 1969, the first mini-split air conditioner
          was sold in the US.Multi-zone ductless systems were invented by Daikin
          in 1973, and variable refrigerant flow systems (which can be thought
          of as larger multi-split systems) were also invented by Daikin in
          1982. Both were first sold in Japan.Variable refrigerant flow systems
          when compared with central plant cooling from an air handler,
          eliminate the need for large cool air ducts, air handlers, and
          chillers; instead cool refrigerant is transported through much smaller
          pipes to the indoor units in the spaces to be conditioned, thus
          allowing for less space above dropped ceilings and a lower structural
          impact, while also allowing for more individual and independent
          temperature control of spaces, and the outdoor and indoor units can be
          spread across the building.Variable refrigerant flow indoor units can
          also be turned off individually in unused spaces.The lower start-up
          power of VRF's DC inverter compressors and their inherent DC power
          requirements also allow VRF solar-powered heat pumps to be run using
          DC-providing solar panels.

      <h2>Ducted central systems</h2>
      <p>
        Split-system central air conditioners consist of two heat exchangers, an
        outside unit (the condenser) from which heat is rejected to the
        environment and an internal heat exchanger (the fan coil unit (FCU), air
        handling unit, or evaporator) with the piped refrigerant being
        circulated between the two. The FCU is then connected to the spaces to
        be cooled by ventilation ducts.

        <p>
          Large central cooling plants may use intermediate coolant such as
          chilled water pumped into air handlers or fan coil units near or in
          the spaces to be cooled which then duct or deliver cold air into the
          spaces to be conditioned, rather than ducting cold air directly to
          these spaces from the plant, which is not done due to the low density
          and heat capacity of air, which would require impractically large
          ducts. The chilled water is cooled by chillers in the plant, which
          uses a refrigeration cycle to cool water, often transferring its heat
          to the atmosphere even in liquid-cooled chillers through the use of
          cooling towers. Chillers may be air- or liquid-cooled.

      <h2>Portable units</h2>
      <p>
        A portable system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor
        unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit
        (such as a ductless split air conditioner).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hose systems, which can be monoblock or air-to-air, are vented to the
        outside via air ducts. The monoblock type collects the water in a bucket
        or tray and stops when full. The air-to-air type re-evaporates the water
        and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously. Such
        portable units draw indoor air and expel it outdoors through a single
        duct, which negatively impacts their overall cooling efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many portable air conditioners come with heat as well as a
        dehumidification function.

        <p>
          The packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC), through-the-wall, and
          window air conditioners are similar. These units are installed on a
          window frame or on a wall opening and the unit usually has an internal
          partition separating its indoor and outdoor sides which contain the
          unit's condenser and evaporator respectively. PTAC systems may be
          adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using
          an electric strip, gas, or other heaters, or by reversing the
          refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior
          air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. They may be
          installed in a wall opening with the help of a special sleeve on the
          wall and a custom grill that is flush with the wall and window air
          conditioners can also be installed in a window, but without a custom
          grill.

      <h2>Packaged air conditioner</h2>
      <p>
        Packaged air conditioners (also known as self-contained units) are
        central systems that integrate into a single housing all the components
        of a split central system, and deliver air, possibly through ducts, to
        the spaces to be cooled. Depending on their construction they may be
        outdoors or indoors, on roofs (rooftop units),draw the air to be
        conditioned from inside or outside a building and be water or
        air-cooled. Often, outdoor units are air-cooled while indoor units are
        liquid-cooled using a cooling tower.
